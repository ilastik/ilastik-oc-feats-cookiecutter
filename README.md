# ilastik object feature plugin cookiecutter

## usage

### prerequisites

You need to have the `cookiecutter` executable available.

### create repository from cookiecutter

```bash
cookiecutter gh:ilastik/ilastik-oc-feats-cookiecutter
```

I recommend doing `git init` in the newly created folder and adding
all content such that changes can be tracked easily.
